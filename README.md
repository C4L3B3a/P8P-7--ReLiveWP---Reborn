# P8P 7: ReLiveWP - Reborn

ReLiveWP that is actually useful for your Lumia/WP 7 device.

This is a fork of WamWooWam's original project: "ReLiveWP", made to relive WP7/WP8's original Live ID/Microsoft services, but the current state of that project is discontinued.

This project was made to integrate with **The P8P Project**, by C4L3B3 & The Nova Team.
