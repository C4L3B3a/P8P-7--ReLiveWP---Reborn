# P8P 7: ReLiveWP - Reborn

A ReLiveWP fork that is actually useful for your Lumia/WP 7 device.

This is a fork of WamWooWam's original project: **"ReLiveWP"**, created to relive WP7/WP8's original Live ID / Microsoft services.  
However, the original project is currently discontinued.

This fork was made to integrate with **The P8P Project**, by **C4L3B3 & The Nova Team**.
